    	<h3> For being relatively new to the Upper East Side, Rabbi Scott Bolton has done a lot to try to make the neighborhood better. </h3>
    </section>

  <section class="story">

<p> “I believe in being a good neighbor always,” Bolton said during a recent interview in his office, a large wood-paneled room filled with religious texts, musical instruments and Bolton’s paintings, made with pages from salvaged Hebrew books.<br></p>

<p>Bolton, 47, moved to the Upper East Side in 2011 with his wife and four children to become the newest rabbi at Or Zarua Synagogue on E. 82nd Street. When he arrived to the neighborhood he was surprised to find real pockets of poverty there. Since starting he’s fostered the congregation’s charity efforts with donations and volunteer work performed at the local level.<br></p>

<p>Bolton and his congregation work closely with the New York Common Pantry, a community based food pantry on E. 109th Street. Stephen Grimaldi, executive director of the organization, says the synagogue contributed almost $8,000 in donated food and financial support last year. Grimaldi credits Bolton with bringing ideas and encouragement to New York Common Pantry all while leading his own congregation’s involvement.<br></p>

<p>Bolton was also instrumental in the launch of ETHOS, Eastside Taskforce for Homeless Outreach and Services, with Upper East Side Councilman and Or Zarua member Ben Kallos. The taskforce convenes neighborhood stakeholders such as faith-based groups, non-profits, and city agencies so they can be helpful to each other and be jointly connected to the city’s policies and resources.<br></p>

<p>“Rabbi Bolton has been a leader in the founding of it and working with all the different partners,” Kallos said.<br></p>

<h4>Or Zarua and Bolton's Background</h4>

<p>Or Zarua is one of the youngest synagogues in the area, founded in 1989. It’s also one of the smallest, occupying a modest 25-foot wide plot. The congregation has around 300 families, compared to nearby Park Avenue Synagogue with approximately 1,650 families. Bolton said that unlike most of the city’s synagogue rabbis, he knows nearly all his congregation.<br></p>

<p>Bolton was born in Brooklyn. He was brought up in a committed Reform Jewish home. Local community service was hugely important to his family. He studied Communications and Criminal Justice at American University in Washington D.C., going on to work for the International Association of Fire Chiefs, a non-profit group supporting firefighters and emergency responders globally. While there, he met the Fire Chief of Israel. The experience was stirring for him.<br> </p>

<p class="blocktext">“I realized I didn’t really know the history of my people and their language,” Bolton said.<br></p>

<p>In 1994, he moved to Jerusalem to start rabbinical school. It was there he met his wife, Amy, also in rabbinical school. Together they heard about the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies in Los Angeles. It’s egalitarian model and teachings spoke to them so they left Jerusalem to attend. Following his ordination there in 2000, Bolton was head of school for nine years at two different Jewish day schools before coming to Or Zarua.<br> </p>

<p>In addition to charity, Bolton focuses on outreach to younger generations and connecting people to themselves and to each other, “the I & the We,” he calls it.<br></p>

<p>When asked how he balances his personal life and work, Bolton’s answer is simple.<br></p>

<p>“I don’t look at this as a profession. This is who I am.”<br></p>
